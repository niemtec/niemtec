## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer with a Computer Science degree specialising in Artificial Intelligence. I'm currently working in the world of mobile app development using Flutter, I have experience with .NET Core micro-service backend glued together with GraphQL and gRPC. I tinker with home automation and sometimes cobble together a post or two on my [blog](niemtec.com).
